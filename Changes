Version 1.0
===========
* First release

Version 1.2
===========
* Many bug fixes and performance enhancements
* Add delta processing using Cache::Memcache (optional).  Delta processing
  allows you to insert your own delta processing logic easily; the module
  comes with a very simplistic built in delta processing routine as well.
* Add cluster aware polling.  If you know one of N servers will have
  a certain OID, you can specify alternate servers that the plugin
  should try if it cannot reach the primary server specified with
  -H or --hostname using multiple -A or --alt-server options
